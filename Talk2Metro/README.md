Description:
The purpose of this project is to enhance the metro-rail ticket booking experience by developing a 
mobile application that leverages modern technologies to provide a seamless, efficient, and 
user-friendly process. By incorporating route mapping, the application aims to eliminate the 
inconveniences of traditional ticket booking methods. This project seeks to improve overall commuter 
satisfaction, reduce wait times, and streamline the ticketing process, ultimately contributing to a 
more efficient and accessible urban transportation system.
